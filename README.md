# gfxTest

This is a trivial graphical program to test candidates skills in a job interview.
The program in its original form shows a 10x10 pixels box in the top left corner of the screen.
Candidates will be asked to analyze the source code, try to determine the screen output and edit the program to make the box move around in various ways.
